# 1.1 Explosion Simulation
This research develops an automated TNT-equivalent simulation model using the Crowl &amp; Louvar, Alonso, and Sadovski methods implemented in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). The model is validated against real incident data to support explosion risk mitigation in industrial facilities.

# 1.2 Problem Formulation
The assessment of explosion impacts from hazardous chemicals such as ammonium nitrate, LPG, and hydrogen is a critical component in industrial risk evaluation. Empirical approaches based on TNT equivalency are widely adopted due to their practicality and efficiency; however, there remains a gap in the availability of automated tools that can systematically expedite the calculation of overpressure and consequence distances. In response to these challenges, this research is directed to address the following key questions:

What is the magnitude of overpressure (in kPa) generated from explosions of ammonium nitrate, LPG, and hydrogen after conversion to TNT equivalent using the Crowl & Louvar, Sadovski, and Alonso methods in an automated VBA-based system?

What are the consequence distances (in meters) corresponding to specific overpressure values, in relation to facility damage thresholds and fatality probabilities?

Do the three empirical methods yield statistically significant differences in calculated overpressure and consequence distances for each substance (AN, LPG, and hydrogen), as evaluated using Full Factorial Design 2‚Å¥ with 4 center points and ANOVA analysis?

# I.3 Research Objectives and Targets

The main objective of this research is to develop an automated simulation for explosion impact assessment using the TNT equivalent approach in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), applying the Crowl & Louvar, Sadovski, and Alonso methods to hazardous substances such as ammonium nitrate, LPG, and hydrogen. The simulation generates overpressure values and consequence distances, which are validated against real incident data and technical literature, to inform risk mitigation strategies in industrial facilities.
